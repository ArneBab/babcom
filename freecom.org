#+title: Babcom: Anonymous, Decentral Comment-System for Static Websites

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Babcom[fn:babcom-name] provides Decentral, Anonymous, Spamresistant comments on Static Websites using [[http://freenetproject.org][Freenet]] with [[http://freesocial.draketo.de/sone_en.html][Sone]] and some simple Javascript.

* What is this?

Babcom is a commenting system for static websites. It is decentral and enables anonymous and non-anonymous commenters to interact seamlessly without giving free reign to spammers.

Thanks go to digger3 with whom I bounced ideas back and forth which led to the current plan and to Sandy from [[https://openitp.org/][OpenITP]] who was really enthusiastic when I told her about this idea.

* Why are you doing this?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/babcom is the internets last, best hope for peace.[fn:hope]/
#+END_QUOTE

One of my pages was hacked. Badly. So badly that I had to kill it. See [[http://gute-neuigkeiten.de][its grave]].

I decided to only use static pages for future projects: Unhackable (with a well-maintained host), Fast, Low-maintenance. Suited for the battlefield of the internet today.

But I still want comments. Without Spam. And without subjugating to a centralized service.

* Sounds cool! Can I try it?

You already do! (see below)

Do you like it?

* I don’t yet run freenet! How does this look?

For me it looks like this:

[[file:2014-02-21-Fr-freecom-screenshot.png]]

/It might look different for you depending on the theme you choose for freenet. What you see above uses the rabbit-hole theme./

* I want that for my site!

Great!

Just copy the following snippet to your site, and you’re good to go. The comments will appear where you pasted the snippet. All the code is inline and pure Javascript, so you can just paste it into any site which accepts HTML.

* How does this work?

The small Javascript above gets the site URL, then it submits a search request on your local Sone instance by creating an iframe with the right URL.

* Isn’t this hard?

That’s what I thought. It is the reason, why it took me half a year of planning and thinking before I actually started. Then I chose to take the simple route and just integrate things which already work well. And the first prototype took just 3 hours (thanks to some great advice from Thomas L. - Thank you!).

But actually Freenet is hard. It provides a censorship resistant, decentral, anonymous, global datastore and took 10 years to get it working as well as it does today. Thanks for that go to Matthew Toseland (our former donation-funded full-time developer who’s now studying at Cambridge) and many contributors.

And the Web of Trust for Spam Resistance in Anonymous Networks is hard. It enables seamless communication between anonymous and non-anonymous users without being drowned in Spam. Thanks for that goes to p0s aka xor.

And Sone is hard. Especially making it easy and enjoyable to use is hard. Thanks for that go to David „Bombe“ Roden.

I just connected them to all the websites out there.

* Where to go from here?

In its current state, this works pretty well (if you already run Freenet and Sone, it loads faster than Disqus), but there are still lots of things which could be improved.

- Some changes in Sone can make Babcom much easier to use.
  - Add a text field to post a message directly to a search (currently you need to go to your profile page and post from there).
  - Precompute Searches for URLs to have almost instant results.
- And then Freenet with the Web of Trust could become easier to setup. If you want to help, plesae see [[contribute][Contribute]]!
- And this script might get a way to store a cookie, to make it remember the location of your node.
- And integration with the Freemail-plugin would be cool, it could provide an anonymous contact-page, maybe using microformats to find the Freemail address for sending in a way which also allows using external tools.
- Integrate into the Freenet-HTML-Filter, so that all freesite authors can just add =<div class=="=freecom-comments"></div>= to get a comment-field.
- Add an “insert to freenet”-button which inserts the current site into freenet and then posts a message with the USK, the title and the original URL. That could be used by authors and would provide strong anonymity for anonymous commenters who write the first real comment. This would require some support from Sone to make it convenient to use.
- Give the freecom-site a better theme - maybe taken from the [[http://draketo.de/proj/hgsite][static site extension]].
- Find a new name: Freecom is the name of a company…

- Comment everywhere: A Greasemonkey-Script which allows commenting any website.

* Using this from Android?

If you want to access babcom-comments from Android, you currently need a home-server running freenet. Then you can forward port 8888 to your android device using ssh:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ssh -NL 8888:localhost:8888 <yourhost>
#+END_SRC

* Who are you?

I’m Arne Babenhauserheide, I live in Graben (Germany) and I’m currently doing my PhD in physics at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). [[http://draketo.de/themes/1w6/minnelli/logo.png]]

I work on Babcom along with other free software and free culture projects, because I want to make the world a better place - if not for me than at least for my children.

The fight against censorship and surveillance is a pretty important battle for that. And one I’m equipped to fight (along with the battle for [[http://freedomdefined.org][free culture]] and spreading roleplaying games as a unique synthesis of art and communication).

You can find more of my stuff on [[http://draketo.de][draketo.de]] (my personal site) and [[http://1w6.org][1w6.org]] (the site of the free roleplaying game I contribute to).

Nowadays Freenet works pretty well, though it still isn’t perfectly polished, so expect some hickups. 
Let’s close this with the quote which made me start using freenet over ten years ago:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"I worry about my child and the Internet all the time, even though she's too young to have logged on yet. Here's what I worry about. I worry that 10 or 15 years from now, she will come to me and say 'Daddy, where were you when they took freedom of the press away from the Internet?'" — Mike Godwin, [[https://www.eff.org/][Electronic Frontier Foundation]]
#+END_QUOTE

# Local Variables:
# org-html-doctype: "html5"
# End:

* Footnotes

[fn:babcom-name] Freecom got renamed to babcom, because freecom is a registered trademark and it does not help the battle against censorship if this site gets sued offline.

[fn:hope] You might recognize this phrase from Babylon 5. There’s a reason for that: If we want all people to be able to publish online without having to succumb to the rules of centralized services, we have to use static websites: Only those can sustainably withstand the constant attacks from crackers. And to have comments in a free internet without subjugating our /visitors/ to centralized sites, we must to use local services. To enable our visitors to speak freely, we must provide anonymous comments. And to make the system resilient against censorship by denial-of-service, we must have a spam-filter. Babcom uses Freenet to provide all this. And it gets defended by many small, coordinated nodes.
